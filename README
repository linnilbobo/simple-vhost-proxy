simple-vhost-proxy is an HTTP reverse proxy for fronting virtual host
web servers.

Example use:
(start-proxy 8080 '(("host1.domain.org" "127.0.0.1" 8081)
                    ("host2.domain.org" "127.0.0.1" 8082)))

Starts a reverse HTTP proxy on port 8080 that forwards HTTP requests
to host1.domain.org to 127.0.0.1:8081, and requests to
host2.domain.org to 127.0.0.1:8082. Any requests with a Host: header
not found in the hosts table are forwarded to the first entry in the
table (so unknown.domain.org gets forwarded to 127.0.0.1:8081).
